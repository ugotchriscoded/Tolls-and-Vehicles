# 🚧 Vehicles and Tolls 🚗

## :bulb:Project description

I made a **program** to model a **toll system**. 

Toll station have a **name**, the **city** in which they are located, and a **numerical value** that represents the **total amount** of **toll collected**.

Vehicles arriving at a toll have a **license plate**. 

The **toll amount** charges depending on the **vehicle type**:

- 🚗: *$100*

- 🏍: *$50*

- 🚚: *$50 is charged for each axle.*

**Toll station** is required to calculate:

- *Toll amount for each vehicle that arrives.*
- *Total amount of pesos collected.*

**System** must print on the screen:

- *List of the vehicles that arrived at the toll.* 
- *Total accumulated.*
