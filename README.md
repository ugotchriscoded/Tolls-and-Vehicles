# üöß Vehicles and Tolls üöó

## :bulb:Project description

I made a **program** to model a **toll system**. 

Toll station have a **name**, the **city** in which they are located, and a **numerical value** that represents the **total amount** of **toll collected**.

Vehicles arriving at a toll have a **license plate**. 

The **toll amount** charges depending on the **vehicle type**:

- üöó: *$100*

- üèç: *$50*

- üöö: *$50 is charged for each axle.*

**Toll station** is required to calculate:

- *Toll amount for each vehicle that arrives.*
- *Total amount of pesos collected.*

**System** must print on the screen:

- *List of the vehicles that arrived at the toll.* 
- *Total accumulated.*

## Requirements:

- **Database** design.
- **API** to add the passage of a vehicle in one of the defined standards.
- Print for each toll, 1 all the vehicles that have passed with their price and the total **(BLADE)**.
- Print for each vehicle how much it has paid in pesetas in total adding all the pesetas through which it has passed.**(BLADE)**.
- **Minimum** coverage 70%.
